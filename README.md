CS-210 Programming Languages

The banking program was created for my coursework at SNHU. It showcases some simple math functions per the assignment parameters. The program as written combines C++ with Python.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The prompt indicated I was to create a program for a bank. It calculates interest rates over a specified number of years considering initial investment, rate of return, and monthly deposits.

What did you do particularly well?
The program completes all specified parameters of the original assignment. Functionally it works quite well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe the program could be more aesthetic. I completed a text based program to complete the initial assignment parameters. While time was a factor, it could certainly use a professional polish despite the functionality.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Getting the calculation correct when taking into account the monthly deposits was a bit of a trial and error process. I continue to use the internet to research when I become confounded by a particular problem or task.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I imagine integrating languages and exposure to multiple programming languages will beneficial moving forward in my career as I will have to continue using and expanding these skills indefinately.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have attempted to use best practice in line citation and formatting to increase readability and understanding of the code I have written in order for it to be useful for others to follow.
